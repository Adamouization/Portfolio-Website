    <h1>My Expertise</h1>
    <p>
        I am a <b>Data Scientist</b> specialised in <b>Machine Learning</b> at NewDay developing predictive models for customer
        underwriting, customer management and fraud detection. I completed my <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> Master’s degree
        from the University of St Andrews, during which I earned the <b>all-time top grade</b> in the Machine Learning module
        with a 99% average and graduated with the <i>Dean’s List Award</i>. Before my Master’s, I graduated from the University
        of Bath with a First-Class Honours degree in Computer Science, which included a 13-month placement as a software
        engineer with the Formula 1 team Scuderia Toro Rosso.
        <br><br>
        My goal is to combine the practical, theoretical and mathematical knowledge that the fields of machine learning
        and software engineering entail in order to develop <b>meaningful</b> and <b>efficient</b> solutions with direct contributions
        to real-life problems and to society. As both a data scientist and coder, I truly enjoy digging deep into the
        data I work with to truly understand and build the best model possible that can be used in real-life scenarios.
        I also enjoy well-designed and documented code, automated CI/CD pipelines with extensive test suites and writing
        code using advanced IDEs.
