    <h1>My Expertise</h1>
    <p>
        I am a <b>Senior Data Scientist</b> at causaLens aiming to revolutionise the world of AI by creating cutting-edge AI
        Agents to enable data science teams to develop faster and more effectively, and by stepping away from
        "traditional correlation" Machine Learning and focusing on causal AI. On the side, I am also building small SaaS
        startups, and am currently working on GlobeFlix.
        <br><br>
        Previously, I worked as a <b>Data Scientist</b> at NewDay developing <b>Machine Learning</b> models for credit decisioning. I hold a
        Master's degree in <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> from the University of St Andrews, during which I earned the <b>all-time top grade</b> 
        in the Machine Learning module with a 99% average and graduated with the <i>Dean’s List Award</i>. Prior to
        this, I earned a First-Class Honours degree in Computer Science from the University of Bath, which included a
        13-month placement as a software engineer with the Formula 1 team Scuderia Toro Rosso.
        <br><br>
        My goal is to combine the practical, theoretical and mathematical knowledge that the fields of machine learning
        and data science entail to develop <b>meaningful</b> and <b>efficient</b> solutions with direct contributions to real-life
        problems and to society. As a software engineer, I truly enjoy creating fully automated pipelines covered by
        extensive test suites, well version-documented and version-controlled code, analysing complex datasets, and
        leveraging state-of-the art tools to deliver impactful results.

        and data science entail in order to develop <b>meaningful</b> and <b>efficient</b> solutions with direct
        contributions

        with to truly understand and build the best model possible that can be used in real-life scenarios.
        As a software engineer, I truly enjoy fully automated pipelines covered by extensive test suites, well
        version-controlled and documented code, analysing the data I'm working with, developing code using state-of-the
        art tools and always learning more by exploring different project. -->
